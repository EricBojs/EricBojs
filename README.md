# Hej hall√•!

Welcome to my Github ‚ú®
Currently, I'm pursuing a masters degree in Financial Mathematics at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden. My B.Sc was in Applied Mathematics and Industrial Economics, also at KTH - I was on an exchange to ETH Z√ºrich where I studied risk mathematics among other things, and I was a visiting student at the University of Nairobi during my last semester. 

I mostly operate in private repos, but some are available to the public (_or somewhat available_) üç≥ Reason for this is that most of my work involve Topological Data Analysis where I use licensed libraries not available to the public yet. 

## [Feasability prediction](https://github.com/KodAgge/Feasibility-Prediction)
üìä Working together with a fintech firm and three classmates we looked into the possibility to use ML algorithms in the technology.
To solve a constrained non-linear optimization problem, the client used an evolutionary algorithm (CMA-ES). Due to the nature of the problem, labeling solutions as feasible or non-feasible turned out to be computationally heavy. Thus, our projects looked into to see if machine learning algorithms could be used to filter out non-feasible solutions. For this, a wide range of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods were studied. Unfortunately, no method yielded fruitful result. This is most likely due to the evolutionary algorithm advancing towards the optimum in iterational steps which were to long leading to an the ML algortithms needing to extrapolate predication in combination with the non-linear constraints being to complex.

## [Barcoding Nairobi](https://github.com/EricBojs/Barcoding-Nairobi)
‚ö° My most interesting work is in the field of **Topological Data Analysis**.
My B.Sc thesis in Applied Mathematics was done at the University of Nairobi and Uber Technologies in Kenya. The code is yet to be published, but you can find the thesis [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-6769&faces-redirect=true&language=en&searchType=SIMPLE&query=bojs&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&pid=diva2%3A1450295&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all) and a my presentation at the African Math Seminar 2020 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwxhMm9wtOY).

## [Os√§ker os√§kerhet](https://github.com/EricBojs/Osaker-osakerhet)
üìà You'll also find a project on financial modelling using Python. The project is in the form of a workbook using Colab/Jupyter Notebook teaching the reader how to download financial data, model financial claims and calculating volatilities (implied and historical). Unfortunely (?), it is only available for the Swedish speaker...
