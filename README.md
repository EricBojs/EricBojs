### Hej hall√•!

Welcome to my Github ‚ú®
Repos are a bit sparse here at the moment, but I'm sure you'll find some of my work interesting. 


## Barcoding Nairobi
‚ö° My most interesting work is in the field of **Topological Data Analysis**.
My B.Sc thesis in Applied Mathematics was done at the University of Nairobi and Uber Technologies in Kenya. The code is yet to be published, but you can find the thesis [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-6769&faces-redirect=true&language=en&searchType=SIMPLE&query=bojs&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&pid=diva2%3A1450295&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all) and a my presentation at the African Math Seminar 2020 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwxhMm9wtOY).

## Os√§ker os√§kerhet
üìà You'll also find a project on financial modelling using Python. The project is in the form of a workbook using Colab/Jupyter Notebook teaching the reader how to download financial data, model financial claims and calculating volatilities (implied and historical). Unfortunely (?), it is only available for the Swedish speaker...
